## Docker, Jenkins and Portainer Installation ##

Run the following commands to install Docker, Jenkins and Portainer on your Ubuntu 18.04 server.

```bash
chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh
```


This Script will install Docker and Docker Compose if not installed already. 
After that it will start Jenkins and Portainer containers.

Help me to improve this script by contributing to this repository.
